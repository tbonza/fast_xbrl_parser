Parsing tool forked from [TiesdeKok/fast_xbrl_parser](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/fast_xbrl_parser). Currently removing features to focus on core feature of 
parsing XBRL documents.

The current iteration is targeting an XBRL parse to Polars dataframe, you can
output whatever file formats are supported by [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars).

TODO -- migration in progress
